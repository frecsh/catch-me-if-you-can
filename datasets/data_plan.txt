shannon entropy (information theory)
    measure of rate of which informationis produced by a source of data 
    - used to detect whether data is likely to be structured or unstructured. 0 < 8(highly unstructured, raondom)

 [x] shannon entropy distribution on algorithm

Shannon Entropy, in the context of information theory, is a measure of the rate at which information is produced by a source of data. It can be used, in a broad sense, to detect whether data is likely to be structured or unstructured. 8 is the maximum, representing highly unstructured, 'random' data. English language text usually falls somewhere between 3.5 and 5. Properly encrypted or compressed data should have an entropy of over 7.5
    [x] will malware families have the same shannon entropy?
